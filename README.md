## HW1 Assignment

1.	Create **ten hypotheses** to test about relationships between potential predictors and diabetes patient engagement. 
An example might be that patients who live close to a clinic are more likely to be highly engaged in their treatment. You may use the readings, information gathered in class, searching the Web, or talking to subject matter experts to generate your hypotheses.  


2.	**Profile the data** in the files using Python as follows: 
Profiling should include at a minimum the number of records in a file, the fields in a record, and for each field, the format of the data, units, the range of values, and summary statistics for numeric data. You should create some **data visualizations to understand the range of values and spot outliers**. 
If you are not familiar with data preparation steps, a good reference is Chapter 3, “Data Preprocessing” in J. Han, M. Kamber and J. Pei, Data Mining Concepts and Techniques, Third Edition, Morgan Kaufmann, 2012 (see slides in https://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/bk3/bk3_slides/03Preprocessing.ppt) 


3.	Derive a subset of the care events (engagement outcomes) from the data files as follows:
*   Skips appointment 
*	Cancels appointment
*	Reschedules appointment

4.	Derive a subset of the engagement predictor variables in the following categories 
*	Demographics. For example, marital status could be derived from EstadoCivil 
*	Geography. For example, distance from clinic is dependent on city and state which are in Ciudad and Estado respectively
